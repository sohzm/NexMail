# NexMail

A simple GUI mail client that encrypts the mail before sending. So even if mail providers like gmail or outlook wanted to read your mail, they can't :)

One caveat though, you'll need this client to decrypt the mail and the associated key.

## Features

+ Login
+ Send Mail (with and without encyption)
+ Read Mail from Inbox
+ Mail search
+ Local mail storage (with encryption)
+ Dark Mode for reading mails
+ Cross Platform
