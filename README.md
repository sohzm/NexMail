A simple GUI mail client that encrypts the mail before sending. So even if mail providers like gmail or outlook wanted to read your mail, they can't :)

One caveat though, you'll need this client to decrypt the mail and the associated key.

- [x] Login
- [ ] Send Mail (with and without encyption)
- [ ] Read Mail from Inbox
- [ ] Mail search
- [ ] Local mail storage (with encryption)
- [ ] Dark Mode for reading mails
- [ ] Cross Platform
- [ ] Tab Layout for multitasking

## Dependencies

+ [PySide6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/)
